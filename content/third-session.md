## Event Details
The third session will consist of one part. 
We'll begin with a roundtable for new participants to share their research interests, followed by a Birds-of-a-Feather-style group discussion.
This time, apart from PhD students and postdocs, we invite MSc students working on NLP-related topics during internship, as well!
The idea is to discuss recent papers in the selected topics.  
The discussion-launching questions would be provided for each topic during the event.
Selected topics:

- Current Limitations of LLMs 
- Multimodal NL
- Reinforcement Learning in NLP
